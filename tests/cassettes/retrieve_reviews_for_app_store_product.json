Half the time it doesn't continuously play through my songs if I lock my phone. Also there's a couple new problems. 1. it plays one song but has the album cover of the song that will play next displayed and 2. When I'm online and search for a band, if I click to see the band's album list the app crashes. And it's not like a random do it once and then it works if I try again. I'll try numerous times and it will crash every time.\",\r\n      \"stars\": \"2.00\",\r\n      \"iso\": \"ZZ\",\r\n      \"version\": \"3.6.2.83\",\r\n      \"date\": \"2015-09-28T05:30:27\",\r\n      \"product\": 5555936,\r\n      \"weight\": 0,\r\n      \"id\": \"5555936L-jrtQAGD-hRcMRaH0oEbvQ\",\r\n      \"predicted_langs\": [\r\n        \"en\"\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"author\": \"Galen Shaw\",\r\n      \"title\": \"My type of slap\",\r\n      \"review\": \"Get the mono e mono........\",\r\n      \"original_title\": \"My type of slap\",\r\n      \"original_review\": \"Get the mono e mono........\",\r\n      \"stars\": \"5.00\",\r\n      \"iso\": \"ZZ\",\r\n      \"version\": \"3.6.2.83\",\r\n      \"date\": \"2015-09-28T03:45:24\",\r\n      \"product\": 5555936,\r\n      \"weight\": 0,\r\n      \"id\": \"5555936LxeXNsF1p737BJKKUdlFppg\",\r\n      \"predicted_langs\": [\r\n        \"en\",\r\n        \"la\",\r\n        \"af\",\r\n        \"cy\",\r\n        \"mr\"\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"author\": \"Humada Alfian\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Actually good, but....\",\r\n      \"review\": \"Don't ever try switch this app go offline, you've got many problem, absolutely.
